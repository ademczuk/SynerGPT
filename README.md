# AI-Driven Conversation System

This project is an AI-driven conversation system that enables two language models, Claude (Manager) and ChatGPT (Worker), to engage in a collaborative and iterative conversation. The system aims to generate meaningful, insightful, and progressively refined responses based on user prompts and dynamic context modeling.

## Features

- Chained conversation between Claude and ChatGPT, where each response serves as the prompt for the next iteration
- Dynamic context modeling and topic tracking for coherent and relevant conversations
- Reinforcement learning techniques for adaptive prompt generation and response refinement
- Sentiment analysis, relevance scoring, and insightfulness evaluation for quality assessment
- Feedback mechanism for iterative improvement and collaborative learning
- Logging and data persistence for conversation history and analysis

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- NLTK
- Gensim
- SQLite

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-conversation-system.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the necessary configuration files and directories.

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
   ```
   python Control.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to enter your initial prompt and specify the maximum number of conversation cycles.

3. The system will initiate the conversation between Claude and ChatGPT, generating responses, analyzing sentiment, evaluating relevance and insightfulness, and providing feedback.

4. The conversation history, along with the associated metrics and feedback, will be logged in the `chat_data.json` file.

5. The labeled dataset will be stored in the `labeled_dataset.json` file, which will be populated with sample data if initially empty.

## Configuration

- Modify the `config.py` file to adjust settings such as logging configuration, file paths, and model parameters.
